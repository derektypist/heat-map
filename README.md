## UX

User stories taken from https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-heat-map

As a user, my heat map should have a title with corresponding `id='title'`.

As a user, my heat map should have a description with corresponding `id='description'`.

As a user, my heat map should have an x-axis with corresponding `id='x-axis'`.

As a user, my heat map should have a y-axis with corresponding `id='y-axis'`.

As a user, my heat map should have `rect` elements with a `class='cell'` that represent
the data.

There should be at least 4 different fill colors used for the cells.

Each cell should have the properties `data-month`, `data-year`, `data-temp` containing their
corresponding month, year and temperature values.
